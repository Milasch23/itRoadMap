# IT Learning Roadmap

This repository documents my learning process as I follow a structured roadmap
to enter the IT industry.

The focus is on reinforcing programming fundamentals, understanding core concepts,
and building consistent study habits through practice and reflection.

## Goals
- Strengthen logical thinking and problem-solving skills
- Learn programming fundamentals using Python
- Reinforce concepts through small, focused exercises
- Practice using Git and GitHub consistently
- Track progress in a clear and honest way

## Repository Structure
Each folder represents a core topic. The files are intentionally simple. Each script focuses on a single concept.

## Notes

This repository is part of an ongoing learning process.
The goal is not to build complex projects, but to develop a solid foundation
by reinforcing concepts and learning from mistakes.
Progress and reflections are updated regularly.
